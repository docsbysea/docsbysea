## Hello, I'm Seethalaxmi Palkumar ðŸŒŠ
Aspiring Technical Writer | Former Prompt Engineer Associate

* I'm currently building my **technical writing portfolio**.
* I hold a Master's Degree in English.
* Previously, I worked as a Prompt Engineer Associate at ![NVIDIA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sco/2/21/Nvidia_logo.svg).
* I'm a storyteller at heart who is passionate about authoring documents that effectively solve real user problems.
* I'm learning skills focused on API documentation, software documentation, structured authoring, and using industry-standard tools like Markdown, DITA, and OpenAPI.
* I'm looking for help/guidance with getting started, best practices in technical writing, and any useful resources on API documentation, developer guides, and industry tools.
